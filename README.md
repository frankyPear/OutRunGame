## OUTRUN ARCADE GAME - 1986

Welcome to my little tribute to OUTRUN! This game was build using SDL and C++ with Visual Studio. 

The objective of this project is to recreate the pseudo 3d technique or also known as 2.5D.
This simulation of projections used during the 70's and 80's had the purpose of bringing a 3d resemblance to the games.

The content of this game was extracted from [Sega System 16 Sprite Viewer](http://reassembler.blogspot.com.es/2012/11/sega-system-16-sprite-viewer.html) other content was extracted manually.
